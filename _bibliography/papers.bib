  abstract = {Schema matching aims to identify the correspondences among attributes of database schemas. It is frequently considered as the most challenging and decisive stage existing in many contemporary web semantics and database systems. Low quality algorithmic matchers fail to provide improvement while manually annotation consumes extensive human efforts. Further complications arise from data privacy in certain domains such as healthcare, where only schema-level matching should be used to prevent data leakage. For this problem, we propose SMAT, a new deep learning model based on state-of-the-art natural language processing techniques to obtain semantic mappings between source and target schemas using only the attribute name and description. SMAT avoids directly encoding domain knowledge about the source and target systems, which allows it to be more easily deployed across different sites. We also introduce a new benchmark dataset, OMAP, based on real-world schema-level mappings from healthcare domain. Our extensive evaluation on a variety of benchmark datasets demonstrate the potential of SMAT to help automate schema-level matching tasks.},

  Abstract = {In silico prediction of drug-target interactions (DTI) is significant for drug discovery because it can largely reduce timelines and costs in the drug development process. Specifically, deep learning-based DTI approaches have been shown promising results in terms of accuracy and low cost for the prediction. However, they pay little attention to the interpretability of their prediction results and feature-level interactions between a drug and a target. In this study, we propose a novel interpretable framework that can provide reasonable cues for the interaction sites. To this end, we elaborately design a gated cross-attention mechanism that crossly attends drug and target features by constructing explicit interactions between these features. The gating function in the method enables neural models to focus on salient regions over entire sequences of drugs and proteins, and the byproduct from the function, which is the attention map, could serve as interpretable factors. The experimental results show the efficacy of the proposed method in two DTI datasets. Additionally, we show that gated cross-attention can sensitively react to the mutation, and this result could provide insights into the identification of novel drugs targeting mutant proteins.},

ABSTRACT = {Previously, our group predicted commercially available Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drugs that can inhibit each step of the replication of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) using a deep learning-based drug-target interaction model called Molecule Transformer-Drug Target Interaction (MT-DTI). Unfortunately, additional clinically significant treatment options since the approval of remdesivir are scarce. To overcome the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) more efficiently, a treatment strategy that controls not only SARS-CoV-2 replication but also the host entry step should be considered. In this study, we used MT-DTI to predict FDA approved drugs that may have strong affinities for the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and the transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) which are essential for viral entry to the host cell. Of the 460 drugs with Kd of less than 100 nM for the ACE2 receptor, 17 drugs overlapped with drugs that inhibit the interaction of ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 spike reported in the NCATS OpenData portal. Among them, enalaprilat, an ACE inhibitor, showed a Kd value of 1.5 nM against the ACE2. Furthermore, three of the top 30 drugs with strong affinity prediction for the TMPRSS2 are anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) drugs, including ombitasvir, daclatasvir, and paritaprevir. Notably, of the top 30 drugs, AT1R blocker eprosartan and neuropsychiatric drug lisuride showed similar gene expression profiles to potential TMPRSS2 inhibitors. Collectively, we suggest that drugs predicted to have strong inhibitory potencies to ACE2 and TMPRSS2 through the DTI model should be considered as potential drug repurposing candidates for COVID-19.},

  abstract = {Abstracts: AACR Special Conference on Advancing Precision Medicine Drug Development: Incorporation of Real-World Data and Other Novel Strategies; January 9-12, 2020; San Diego, CADespite the potential of anticancer drugs in the early stages of drug development, many clinical trials have failed at phase III because of low efficacy and/or high toxicity profiles. To improve such issues, effective lead optimization based on machine learning (ML) is needed. Many ML-based lead optimization models have been proposed, but they are capable of optimizing only a single property of a drug; therefore, multiple models are required and would likely be significantly different from the original drug as processed by multiple models. Our contributions are as follows: 1) We devised a new deep learning architecture based on a long short-term memory on a convolutional neural network for predicting binding affinity score (AS) and absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) prediction. 2) We adapted the Molecule Deep Q-Networks (MoleDQN) to our new reward combinations so that a single model can consider multiple properties such as quantitative estimate of drug-likeness (QED), AS, synthetic accessibility scores (SAS), and toxicity scores. 3) Binding affinity estimator and ADMET estimator are used to indicate drug efficacy and toxicities. Iniparib, brivanib, and rebimastat, which failed in phase III clinical trials, were used for this analysis, and the top two optimized candidates of each drug with an improved score were selected. Iniparib was developed as a PARP inhibitor, but QED and AS were not predicted as a potential drug in our model (QED, 0.51; SAS, 2.23; AS, 5.02). This may be related to the low efficacy reported in clinical trials. Thus, iniparib was optimized for improved QED and AS to increase efficacy. Optimized candidates OPT-INI-01 (QED, 0.85; SAS, 3.33; AS, 7.77) and OPT-INI-02 (QED, 0.83; SAS, 3.15; AS, 7.93) were qualified with QED higher than 0.8 and demonstrated AS higher than 7.0, which is equivalent to Kd \&lt; 100 nM. Brivanib (QED, 0.56; SAS, 3.42; AS, 6.13), which targets VEGFR2, failed in clinical studies with low efficacy and unexpected toxicity (heart toxicity score, hERG, 0.77). To improve the efficacy of brivanib, hERG scores were added to the optimization properties to produce less toxic molecules. BRIV-OPT-01 (QED, 0.61; SAS, 2.80; AS, 7.79, hERG, 0.45) and BRIV-OPT-02 (QED, 0.60; SAS, 3.01; AS, 7.86; hERG, 0.41) were optimized and showed less than 0.5 in hERG score with AS higher than 7.0. Rebimastat (QED, 0.26; SAS, 3.95; AS, 7.44) targeting MMPs did not show satisfactory clinical results due to skin hypersensitivity (skin toxicity score, STS, 0.74). Thus, optimization was performed with focus on the STS and AS. REB-OPT-01 (QED, 0.35; SAS, 4.48; AS, 8.44, STS, 0.49) and REB-OPT-02 (QED, 0.52; SAS, 4.33; AS, 7.80; STS, 0.53) showed less than 0.55 in STS and better overall results than that of rebimastat. In conclusion, this work may improve and accelerate drug development through ML methods that use differential weights for different properties such as efficacy and toxicity, and it may make it easily accessible and less expensive to test new drug candidates in the real world.Citation Format: Sungsoo Park, Yoon Ho Ko, Bora Lee, Bonggun Shin, Bo Ram Beck.

  Abstract = {The infection of a novel coronavirus found in Wuhan of China (SARS-CoV-2) is rapidly spreading, and the incidence rate is increasing worldwide. Due to the lack of effective treatment options for SARS-CoV-2, various strategies are being tested in China, including drug repurposing. In this study, we used our pre-trained deep learning-based drug-target interaction model called Molecule Transformer-Drug Target Interaction (MT-DTI) to identify commercially available drugs that could act on viral proteins of SARS-CoV-2. The result showed that atazanavir, an antiretroviral medication used to treat and prevent the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), is the best chemical compound, showing an inhibitory potency with Kd of 94.94 nM against the SARS-CoV-2 3C-like proteinase, followed by remdesivir (113.13 nM), efavirenz (199.17 nM), ritonavir (204.05 nM), and dolutegravir (336.91 nM). Interestingly, lopinavir, ritonavir, and darunavir are all designed to target viral proteinases. However, in our prediction, they may also bind to the replication complex components of SARS-CoV-2 with an inhibitory potency with Kd < 1,000 nM. In addition, we also found that several antiviral agents, such as Kaletra (lopinavir/ritonavir), could be used for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2. Overall, we suggest that the list of antiviral drugs identified by the MT-DTI model should be considered, when establishing effective treatment strategies for SARS-CoV-2.},

  Abstract = {Artificial neural network-based analysis has recently been used to predict clinical outcomes in patients with solid cancers, including lung cancer. However, the majority of algorithms were not originally developed to identify genes associated with patients' prognoses. To address this issue, we developed a novel prognosis-related feature selection framework called Cascaded Wx (CWx). The CWx framework ranks features according to the survival of a given cohort, by training neural networks with three different high- and low-risk groups in a cascaded fashion. We showed that this approach accurately identified features which best identify the patients' prognoses, as compared to other feature selection algorithms, including the cox proportional hazard and Coxnet models, when applied to the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) transcriptome data. The prognostic potential of the top 100 genes identified by CWx outperformed or was comparable to those identified by the other methods as assessed by concordance index (c-index). In addition, the top 100 genes identified by CWx were found to be associated with the Wnt signaling pathway, providing biologically relevant evidence for the value of these genes in predicting the prognosis of patients with LUAD. Further analyses of other cancer types showed that the genes identified by CWx had the highest prognostic values according to c-index. Collectively, the CWx framework will potentially be of great use to prognosis-related biomarker discoveries in a variety of diseases.},

  Abstract = {Next-generation sequencing (NGS), which allows the simultaneous sequencing of billions of DNA fragments simultaneously, has revolutionized how we study genomics and molecular biology by generating genome-wide molecular maps of molecules of interest. However, the amount of information produced by NGS has made it difficult for researchers to choose the optimal set of genes. We have sought to resolve this issue by developing a neural network-based feature (gene) selection algorithm called Wx. The Wx algorithm ranks genes based on the discriminative index (DI) score that represents the classification power for distinguishing given groups. With a gene list ranked by DI score, researchers can institutively select the optimal set of genes from the highest-ranking ones. We applied the Wx algorithm to a TCGA pan-cancer gene-expression cohort to identify an optimal set of gene-expression biomarker candidates that can distinguish cancer samples from normal samples for 12 different types of cancer. The 14 gene-expression biomarker candidates identified by Wx were comparable to or outperformed previously reported universal gene expression biomarkers, highlighting the usefulness of the Wx algorithm for next-generation sequencing data. Thus, we anticipate that the Wx algorithm can complement current state-of-the-art analytical applications for the identification of biomarker candidates as an alternative method. The stand-alone and web versions of the Wx algorithm are available at https://github.com/deargen/DearWXpub and https://wx.deargendev.me/, respectively.},

  Abstract = {Predicting drug-target interactions (DTI) is an essential part of the drug discovery process, which is an expensive process in terms of time and cost. Therefore, reducing DTI cost could lead to reduced healthcare costs for a patient. In addition, a precisely learned molecule representation in a DTI model could contribute to developing personalized medicine, which will help many patient cohorts. In this paper, we propose a new molecule representation based on the self-attention mechanism, and a new DTI model using our molecule representation. The experiments show that our DTI model outperforms the state of the art by up to 4.9%p in terms of area under the precision-recall curve. Moreover, a study using the DrugBank database proves that our model effectively lists all known drugs targeting a specific cancer biomarker in the top-30 candidate list.},

  Abstract = {Recent advances in deep learning have facilitated the demand of neural models for real applications. In practice, these applications often need to be deployed with limited resources while keeping high accuracy. This paper touches the core of neural models in NLP, word embeddings, and presents a new embedding distillation framework that remarkably reduces the dimension of word embeddings without compromising accuracy. A novel distillation ensemble approach is also proposed that trains a high-efficient student model using multiple teacher models. In our approach, the teacher models play roles only during training such that the student model operates on its own without getting supports from the teacher models during decoding, which makes it eighty times faster and lighter than other typical ensemble methods. All models are evaluated on seven document classification datasets and show significant advantage over the teacher models for most cases. Our analysis depicts insightful transformation of word embeddings from distillation and suggests a future direction to ensemble approaches using neural models.},

  Abstract = {Electronic Health Records (EHRs) have been heavily used to predict various downstream clinical tasks such as readmission or mortality. One of the modalities in EHRs, clinical notes, has not been fully explored for these tasks due to its unstructured and inexplicable nature. Although recent advances in deep learning (DL) enables models to extract interpretable features from unstructured data, they often require a large amount of training data. However, many tasks in medical domains inherently consist of small sample data with lengthy documents; for a kidney transplant as an example, data from only a few thousand of patients are available and each patient's document consists of a couple of millions of words in major hospitals. Thus, complex DL methods cannot be applied to these kind of domains. In this paper, we present a comprehensive ensemble model using vector space modeling and topic modeling. Our proposed model is evaluated on the readmission task of kidney transplant patients, and improves 0.0211 in terms of c-statistics from the previous state- of-the-art approach using structured data, while typical DL methods fails to beat this approach. The proposed architecture provides the interpretable score for each feature from both modalities, structured and unstructured data, which is shown to be meaningful through a physician's evaluation.},

This paper introduces a novel approach to sentiment analysis that integrates lexicon embeddings and an attention mechanism into Convolutional Neural Networks. Our approach performs separate convolutions for word and lexicon embeddings and provides a global view of the document using attention. Our models are experimented on both the SemEval'16 Task 4 dataset and the Stanford Sentiment Treebank, and show comparative or better results against the existing state-of-the-art systems.

Distinguished from previous studies, our approach embraces a double-annotated dataset and strays away from obscure ``black-box'' models to comprehensive deep learning models. In this paper, we present a novel neural attention mechanism that not only classifies clinically important findings. Specifically, convolutional neural networks (CNN) with attention analysis are used to classify radiology head computed tomography reports based on five categories that radiologists would account for in assessing acute and communicable findings in daily practice. The experiments show that our CNN attention models outperform non-neural models, especially when trained on a larger dataset. Our attention analysis demonstrates the intuition behind the classifier's decision by generating a heatmap that highlights attended terms used by the CNN model; this is valuable when potential downstream medical decisions are to be performed by human experts or the classifier information is to be used in cohort construction such as for epidemiological studies.},
